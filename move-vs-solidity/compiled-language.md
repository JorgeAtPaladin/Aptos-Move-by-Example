# Compiled language

_Move_ and _Solidity_ are both compiled programming languages, but there are some differences between them.

Move is a statically-typed language developed by Facebook. It emphasizes safety and security, with features such as resource ownership and borrowing, and it is optimized for efficiency and low gas fees. Move's compiler generates bytecode that is executed on the Move Virtual Machine.

Solidity, on the other hand, is a contract-oriented, high-level programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is also statically-typed and compiled, but it has some dynamic features as well. Solidity's compiler generates bytecode that is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Both Move and Solidity share similarities in their syntax and structure, but they are optimized for different blockchains and use cases. In terms of their compilation process, both languages require a compilation step before they can be executed on their respective blockchain's virtual machine.
